## Initial Discussion Document - READ THIS FIRST
[Initial Project Plan Thoughts](./init-discussion.md)

## Application Goals (Draft)
* Create an application with a C# backend and a React front end that is modeled on the Medium Snowflake project. 
* Create an application that is NOT modeled for the specific use of Code Fellows but that has a universal HR appeal.
* Consider additional "add-on" proficiencies/features that could increase the usability of the application for a specific industry.
* Unlike the 41 proficiencies of the final project we will focus on a smaller number of softskill competencies to start with a possible scalable add on for specific industries. 
* Have an admin panel with the capability to change scoring, add competencies/proficiencies, edit existing application text and other features as determined by project team.
* Have a minimum of 4 different roles (superuser, admin, manager, and user)
* A user can save "what-if-scenarios" or generate a report of their own progress over time - Like for Code Fellows 201/301/401 students to see their personal progress over time
* For the purpose of quarterly reviews a manager can save scores for users they manage
* Scores are saved on a monthly basis (if there are multiple scoring sessions in the month of May they would overwrite previous May scores)
* Allow a variety of reports to be created based on role permissions that could show various scoring metrics across all users or for a specific group of users.
