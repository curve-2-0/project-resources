# Curve 2.0: Let's discuss!

Using .NET Core React App will make for ease of deployment, organization, development, and data management.

This repository is a collection of notes about starting Curve 2.0. It's just a primer, and it's going to move from this location to wherever the project lives.

In either form, public or private, we should have the standard style agreements/discussion about conflict resolution but also ownership, MVP, complete design, any anything else. In terms of ownership, there's public and private:

### public / open source

High development visibility with recruiters

Easy on the wallet getting started.

Low commitment / pressure

Invitation ready, and potentially joiners 
(hack night?)

CF wins the "pay to develop things for us" game.

### private

Monetizable in several ways, including the "pay for full service" model, where anyone can come and use it and those who pay get features enough to make full use.

Finished product very attractive on resume.

We are on our own, but we are together.

Legal considerations: If we plan to develop together and sell, the best way is to get copyright in which we all put our names on it. This protects us from outsiders and each other.

If we go in on joint copyright it would seem best to have a private GH organization to mirror that:

With 20-25 people, our monthly bill for GH is 160-205 a month. Then there are Azure costs.

Why find a job when you can create one? We should talk about things like: if we hustle it, do we form a company and kick off? Sell it outright?

### Other notes:

Alex has suggested discord for communication.

Time and meetings, we are no longer pent up in the same schedule. So, we'll be working remotely or together whenever needed/wanted/time allows. Thank goodness we have a task master!

Hack nights have been suggested as a main meeting time, which would also give us a platform to present on when it's complete (open source requirement question mark?) Other times?

We have Erin to help us coordinate people, and I've suggested using Azure DevOps for task management given that it's integrated with Visual Studio. If that's the case, .NET peeps can fast track the JS peeps on it, and the IDE. I'm happy to provide a demo/workshop(s).
